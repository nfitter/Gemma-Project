# Gemma-Project

Tutorials and an introductory project for the Adafruit Gemma microcontroller.

The GEMMA_blink_code is the program we loaded onto your microcontroller during the Stouffer Wearable Electronics 101 workshop.

Other documents that I will dd later will include more in-depth tutorials on how to load new code onto your Gemma board.
